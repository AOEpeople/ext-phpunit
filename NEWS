31. March 2008: Version 3.2.10

31. March 2008: Version 3.2.9
	~ Moved database tests out of class tx_phpunit_testcase and into tx_phpunit_database_testcase.
	* Drops database in createDatabase() before trying to create it.

31. March 2008: Version 3.2.8
	* Bug fix release. Removed call in mod1/class.tx_phpunit_module1.php to Typo3 4.2 specific function loadJavascriptLib().
	
30. March 2008: Version 3.2.7
	* Bug fix release. Fixes #7964, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=7964

29. March 2008: Version 3.2.6
	+ Added extension icons to selector boxes (note: not working with Opera).
	+ Added PHPUnit 3.2.17, see Changelog at http://phpunit.de/wiki/ChangeLog32#PHPUnit3.2.1729-Mar-2008
	- Removed PHPUnit 3.2.16.

27. March 2008: Version 3.2.5
	+ Added new UI for running tests: You will need to set the new option ' Experimental test interface' in the Extension Manager (EM).  This adresses issue #6965, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6965. Thanks to Mikkel Ricky who provided the new implementation. 

24. March 2008: Version 3.2.4
	+ Experimental support for Code Coverage reporting. Turned of by default, since you need to setup XDebug and it slows down unit testing considerably!
	+ Previously there was a total timelimit of 30 seconds. Now the timelimit is per testcase; this is done by inserting a call to set_time_limit(30) in the testlistener.
	+ Expanded 'About PHPUnit BE': Added links to bugs.typo3.org and phpunit on typo3xdev.sf.net. Added SÃ¸ren Soltveit to contributor list. Added test for XDebug extension (needed for code coverage) and test for memory limit, which should be set to something like 256MB, when using code coverage!
	+ New (experimental) progressbar: First stab at bugs #6972 and #6975. Turned off by default. Works badly: Overflows to the right, when there are many tests.
	- Removed variable addAttrib in SVN revision 8639. Solves issue #7011, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=7011

	~ Added array type hint to function getFirstNonPHPUnitTrace in class tx_phpunit_testlistener.
	* Errors are now marked red (instead of yellow). Solves bug #6977, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6977.

18. March 2008: Version 3.2.3
	+ New helper functions in tx_phpunit_testcase: You can now use the Typo3 database from your tests. E.g. for creating new tables for your tests. Reminder: Never run tests in a production environment.
	+ Tests for new helper functions added in class database_testcase. Note: You will need to manually install the four extensions named 'aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc' and 'ddd' (they can be found in tests/res/).

	* (Temporary) fix for issue #7631, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=7631#c19761, courtesy Mario Rimann.

19. December 2007: Version 3.2.2
	~ Changed header in BE module: It now writes the version string from the PHPUnit currently in use. This makes it easier to verify that the correct version is used. Closes http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6985
	* Removed white background from phpunit-be.css.
	* Changed path in ext_localconf.php to uppercase. Solves problem, where using the shipped PHPUnit did not work on systems where upper case / lower case is respected (e.g. Linux systems).

17. December 2007: Version 3.2.1 - The 'Remember PEAR file structure!' release.
	* Moved files in PHPUnit-3.2.6 directory to a PHPUnit sub-directory. Closes http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6994
	~ Updated News part of manual.

17. December 2007: Version 3.2.0 - The 'There is money to be made' release!
	~ Bumped version number, since phpunit now ships with PHPUnit version 3.2.6
	+ Added a NEWS file, which holds the info which was previously in the Changelog file.
	~ Changed the Changelog file to hold Subversion commits. This is meant to be added by a pre-commit hook on svn, when extension development is moved to typo3xdev.sf.net.

22. October 2007: Version 3.1.15
	~ Extension test selector now groups the tests under the test suite they are part of (Usability request from Elmar Hinz of the ECT).

	+ Added German translation, thanks to Mario Rimann :-)

17. October 2007: Version 3.1.13

	+ Added info to 'About' if 'use pear' is set, but pear is not loaded. Defaults to phpunit provided PHPunit in that case (instead of just aborting).
	~ Updated manual to mention pear integration and made the Changelog current (and updated index).

17. October 2007: Version 3.1.12
	+ Added 'Exclude extensions' option in extension manager setup. This allows you to set extension that phpunit should never search for tests (also applies to 'out of line'-paths).
	+ Added info about currently excluded extensions to 'About phpunit BE' submodule.

17. October 2007: Version 3.1.11
	* Two identically named tests in different testsuites are now distinguished.
	* Having the same extension installed as both local and global now works: Tests in the active one is run.

15. October 2007: Version 3.1.10
	+ Added 'out-of-line' tests: These are tests that are now in the extension itself, but found on a path you give in the extension manager.
	+ Added information notice to eAccelerator 0.9.5.1 users about optimizer bug in eAccelerator.
	+ Added 'Contributors' section to About box.
	+ Fully translated into danish (except for the texts coming from PHPUnit).
	+ Added stylesheet file, phpunit-be.css.
	~ Changed layout of test runs to make them more easily readable.
	~ Changed the two failing tests, that comes with phpunit: Now they give a message that they are meant to fail.

	* Corrected display of failure notices from failed tests: Assertion types/values are shown again.
	* Corrected logo image display in About box.
	

10. October 2007: Version 3.1.9
	+ Added 'include_path' output to the 'About' sub-module. This can be used to check where the extension is looking for PHPUnit.
	+ Added extension manager configuration option to point to another PHPUnit, than the one provided by the extension (could be a PEAR installed PHPUnit).
	+ Added PHPUnit version 3.1.9
	+ Added PHPUnit version 3.0.6: You must provide the absolute path to it in the extension manager conf (including ending slash) to use this version.
	- Removed PHPUnit version 3.0.5
	~ Changed to using Typo3 v. 4.1.x feature of mod.php for the backend module, cf.  http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/core-documentation/doc_core_inside/4.1.0/view/3/5/#id3561091
	~ Changed version number to 3.1.9.
	~ Changed state to beta.
	~ Changed ChangeLog Legend and updated the complete file to reflect this.
	* Corrected the way the lib is found: Now you only have do do it in one place. Note that PHPUnit is expected to be in a sub-directory called 'PHPUnit' of the place you write.
	* Corrected the progressbar, so now it stays within the browser window (Thanks to Mikkel Ricky for the fix :-)
	* Corrected a bug, where an error about class tx_t3unit_testcase was spewed (Thanks to Mario Rimann for pointing out and Mikkel Ricky for fixing).

13. March 2007: Version 3.0.52
	+ Added class tx_t3unit_testcase for providing backwards compatibility with t3unit (suggested by Robert Lemke).
	+ Added t3unit and pear_phpunit2 to conflicts in file ext_emconf.php (suggested by Robert Lemke).
	~ Changed version number in file ext_emconf.php to 3.0.52.
	* Corrected depends in file ext_emconf.php (suggested by Robert Lemke)
		from: 'php' => '5.2.1-0.0.0', 'typo3' => '4.1-0.0.0', 
		to: 'php' => '5.2.1-', 'typo3' => '4.1-',
